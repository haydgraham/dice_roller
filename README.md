# first_app

Welcome to my first Flutter app. My goal with this simple application was to get familiar with Flutter development fundamentals:
- Researching Flutter's docs and utilizing the widget catalog to build a simple app
- Creating custom Flutter Widgets of my own
- Implementing Stateless and Stateful widgets for static/dynamic UI elements
